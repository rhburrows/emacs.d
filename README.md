This is my emacs configuration based on the emacs-starter-kit

This is a fresh start on organizing my configuration of emacs. My old
configuration was starting to get quite large and was slowly filling
with configuration code that I no longer use. By basing my new
configuration on the emacs starter kit I am trying to use as much code
from ELPA as possible so I can minimize the amount of code I need to
maintain.

I'm slowly in the process of copying settings from my old
configuration over as I miss them, that way I don't bother to copy
settings that I don't actually use. My old emacs configuration can be
found here:
