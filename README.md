# Ryan's Emacs config

## Description

This is a work in progress.

`master` is still the config I am actively using most of the time, it
is based on [prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). This is an
attempt to simplify my configuration considerably and to fully
understand all of the settings/packages I have installed. Once its
ready it will be switched to the master branch
