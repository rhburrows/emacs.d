# Ryan's Emacs config

## Description

This is my current emacs config. I'm constantly adding to it and
trying to remember to remove things I am no longer using. Maybe
someday I'll write up a real description...

My old `prelude`-based configuration is in the `old-master` branch.

An even older before I tried `prelude` version is in the
`before-prelude` branch.

Even older still: check the https://github.com/rhburrows/emacs
repository. These do not represent a comprehensive history of my
configurations but they have a decent amount
