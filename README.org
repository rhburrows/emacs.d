* Ryan's Emacs config

This branch is a currently in-process re-write of my emacs
configuration. There's a few reasons I'm re-writing it:

    - To remove packages I'm not actually using
    - To explore new packages or newer replacements to ones I use
    - To try and use lsp-mode to make many of my programming
    environments more consistent
    - For fun
