* Ryan's Emacs config

This branch is a currently in-process re-write of my emacs
configuration. There's a few reasons I'm re-writing it:

    - To remove packages I'm not actually using
    - To explore new packages or newer replacements to ones I use
    - To try and use lsp-mode to make many of my programming
    environments more consistent
    - For fun

* Packages to check out and/or configure

  - pdf-tools
  - json-reformat
  - restclient
  - multi-term (or other terminal setup)
  - rainbow-mode
  - rainbow-delimeters
  - aweshell

* Description

  TODO: Fill out this description as you add and configure packages

** External dependencies

   - The Silver Searcher (ag) must be installed for counsel-ag to be activated
